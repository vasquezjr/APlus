## For Testing
1. Identify The Problem
Identification is often the easiest step. It may be accomplished via an inbound phone call from a user, a help desk ticket, an email message, a log file entry or any number of other sources. It is not at all uncommon for users to alert you to the problem.
It’s important to recognize that the root cause of specific issues is not always apparent. For example, a failed login attempt might seem to indicate a username or password problem, when instead the real issue may be a lack of network connectivity that prevents the authentication information from being checked against a remote server.

As troubleshooters, you want to be very careful to ensure you have identified the root cause of the error, misconfiguration or service interruption before making any changes.

Specific steps here may include:

Gathering information from log files and error messages
Questioning users
Identifying symptoms
Determining recent changes
Duplicating the problem
Approaching multiple problems one at a time
Narrowing the scope of the problem

3. Establish a Theory of Probably Cause
	
Words such as theory and probable indicate a guess on your part, even if it is a guess backed by data. Keep in mind that the root cause (as determined in identifying the problem) may not have been accurately identified. However, the cause is specific enough to begin troubleshooting.

This step may require significant research on your part. Vendor documentation, your organization’s own documentation, and a good old-fashioned Google search may all be required to provide the basis for your theory.

Specific steps here may include:

Questioning the obvious
Considering multiple approaches, including top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top for layered technologies (such as networks)

5. Test the Theory to Determine the Cause
6. Establish a Plan of ACtion and Implement the Solution
7. Document Findings
